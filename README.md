# Human Validation of Linguistic Data in UzWordnet by Role Gaming

## Description
A program called the Linguistic Data Validator was created to improve UzWordNet by integrating human validation. It enables people to successfully validate and add information regardless of their level of skill. Upon enrollment, users are placed into one of four proficiency levels based on the results of a competency assessment: beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert. This guarantees that contributions are fairly assessed and acknowledged.

Any user, regardless of skill level, can add or alter content. Experts must, however, assess the revisions of those with fewer than ten confirmed validations. Users can save their revisions without additional evaluation if they have at least ten validated contributions. The ranking system ensures the integrity and correctness of linguistic data by designating as top contributors the most accurate and prolific members of the community.

## FAQ
### What tasks will the Linguistic Data Validator not perform?
In order to preserve the integrity and correctness of linguistic data, the system limits the autonomy of decision-making to expert validation. Users with high scores cannot bypass the validation process that static experts have put in place.
